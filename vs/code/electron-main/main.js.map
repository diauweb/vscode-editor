Even if 'b' is present in path2, as 'b' is suffix of path1 and is not suffix of path2, unique path will be '...\\\\b'.\n * 2. for path2, 'c' is not present in path1 hence unique path is '..\\\\c'.\n */\nconst ellipsis = '\\u2026';\nconst unc = '\\\\\\\\';\nconst home = '~';\nexport function shorten(paths: string[], pathSeparator: string = sep): string[] {\n\tconst shortenedPaths: string[] = new Array(paths.length);\n\n\t// for every path\n\tlet match = false;\n\tfor (let pathIndex = 0; pathIndex < paths.length; pathIndex++) {\n\t\tlet path = paths[pathIndex];\n\n\t\tif (path === '') {\n\t\t\tshortenedPaths[pathIndex] = `.${pathSeparator}`;\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tif (!path) {\n\t\t\tshortenedPaths[pathIndex] = path;\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tmatch = true;\n\n\t\t// trim for now and concatenate unc path (e.g. \\\\network) or root path (/etc, ~/etc) later\n\t\tlet prefix = '';\n\t\tif (path.indexOf(unc) === 0) {\n\t\t\tprefix = path.substr(0, path.indexOf(unc) + unc.length);\n\t\t\tpath = path.substr(path.indexOf(unc) + unc.length);\n\t\t} else if (path.indexOf(pathSeparator) === 0) {\n\t\t\tprefix = path.substr(0, path.indexOf(pathSeparator) + pathSeparator.length);\n\t\t\tpath = path.substr(path.indexOf(pathSeparator) + pathSeparator.length);\n\t\t} else if (path.indexOf(home) === 0) {\n\t\t\tprefix = path.substr(0, path.indexOf(home) + home.length);\n\t\t\tpath = path.substr(path.indexOf(home) + home.length);\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// pick the first shortest subpath found\n\t\tconst segments: string[] = path.split(pathSeparator);\n\t\tfor (let subpathLength = 1; match && subpathLength <= segments.length; subpathLength++) {\n\t\t\tfor (let start = segments.length - subpathLength; match && start >= 0; start--) {\n\t\t\t\tmatch = false;\n\t\t\t\tlet subpath = segments.slice(start, start + subpathLength).join(pathSeparator);\n\n\t\t\t\t// that is unique to any other path\n\t\t\t\tfor (let otherPathIndex = 0; !match && otherPathIndex < paths.length; otherPathIndex++) {\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// suffix subpath treated specially as we consider no match 'x' and 'x/...'\n\t\t\t\t\tif (otherPathIndex !== pathIndex && paths[otherPathIndex] && paths[otherPathIndex].indexOf(subpath) > -1) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconst isSubpathEnding: boolean = (start + subpathLength === segments.length);\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// Adding separator as prefix for subpath, such that 'endsWith(src, trgt)' considers subpath as directory name instead of plain string.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// prefix is not added when either subpath is root directory or path[otherPathIndex] does not have multiple directories.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconst subpathWithSep: string = (start > 0 && paths[otherPathIndex].indexOf(pathSeparator) > -1) ? pathSeparator + subpath : subpath;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconst isOtherPathEnding: boolean = paths[otherPathIndex].endsWith(subpathWithSep);\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmatch = !isSubpathEnding || isOtherPathEnding;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// found unique subpath\n\t\t\t\tif (!match) {\n\t\t\t\t\tlet result = '';\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// preserve disk drive or root prefix\n\t\t\t\t\tif (segments[0].endsWith(':') || prefix !== '') {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif (start === 1) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// extend subpath to include disk drive prefix\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstart = 0;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubpathLength++;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubpath = segments[0] + pathSeparator + subpath;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif (start > 0) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresult = segments[0] + pathSeparator;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresult = prefix + result;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// add ellipsis at the beginning if needed\n\t\t\t\t\tif (start > 0) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresult = result + ellipsis + pathSeparator;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\tresult = result + subpath;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// add ellipsis at the end if needed\n\t\t\t\t\tif (start + subpathLength < segments.length) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresult = result + pathSeparator + ellipsis;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\tshortenedPaths[pathIndex] = result;\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tif (match) {\n\t\t\tshortenedPaths[pathIndex] = path; // use full path if no unique subpaths found\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn shortenedPaths;\n}\n\nexport interface ISeparator {\n\tlabel: string;\n}\n\nenum Type {\n\tTEXT,\n\tVARIABLE,\n\tSEPARATOR\n}\n\ninterface ISegment {\n\tvalue: string;\n\ttype: Type;\n}\n\n/**\n * Helper to insert values for specific template variables into the string.
